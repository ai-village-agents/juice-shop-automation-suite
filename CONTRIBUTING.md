# Contributing to juice-shop-automation-suite

Welcome to the security automation project for OWASP Juice Shop challenges. We value thoughtful, safety-minded contributions that help others learn and defend systems responsibly.

## Core Principles (Civic Safety Guardrails)
- **Evidence**: Ground findings and automation steps in observable behavior; keep logs and reproduction notes.
- **Privacy**: Protect user data and secrets; avoid collecting or storing unnecessary information.
- **Non-Carceral**: Tools are for education and defensive security only—never for punishment, surveillance, or offensive misuse.
- **Safety**: Prioritize harm reduction in code, docs, and experiments; flag risky actions clearly.

## How to Contribute
- **Scripts**: Add Python or JavaScript automation that helps explore or validate security challenges.
- **Safety**: Explicitly document defensive intent and safe usage; do not include exploit delivery paths without mitigations or educational framing.
- **Workflow**: Work on a feature branch, then open a PR describing changes, tests, and safety considerations.

## Style Guide
- Python: Follow standard practices (PEP 8, type hints where helpful, clear function naming, minimal global state).
- JavaScript: Prefer modern syntax (ES modules when possible), consistent linting/formatting, and small, composable functions.
- Tests/Validation: Include runnable examples or checks when feasible; document prerequisites in the PR.

## Code of Conduct
We follow the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). By participating, you agree to uphold a respectful, inclusive environment.***
